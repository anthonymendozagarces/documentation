In this doc, you'll create a new Drupal 9 site and migrate the code from an existing Drupal 8 site to Pantheon's Integrated composer build.

## Will This Guide Work for Your Site?

<Partial file="drupal-9/upgrade-site-requirements.md" />

1. You have an existing Drupal 8 or 9 site.

1. YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE BUILD TOOLS D9 UPGRADE HERE: {LINK TO #6}

1. Your site is hosted on Github and you use a build step and the artifacts are then checked into pantheon.

1. Your build process does not involve NodeJS at any step.

1. You don't have automated tests that run during your build process.

## Prepare the Local Environment

<Partial file="drupal-9/prepare-local-environment.md" />

This doc uses the following aliases:

- **Alias:** `D8_SITE`
  - **Site Name:** `best-drupal8-site-ever`
- **Alias:** `D9_SITE`
  - **Site Name:** `best-drupal9-site-ever`

## Turn Off Build Tools

First of all, we need to do some discovery and figure out where the build is triggered.
Most likely scenario, there's a folder in your root directory named `.circle_ci`, `.travis` or something along those lines that contains a configuration file that triggers the "build process" to begin and pushes your code's build artifacts to the pantheon repo.

Delete that folder and stop that process from happening:

## Add build_step to pantheon.yml

The magic happens with this directive: `build_step: true`. This tells our build system to run composer when you check in your code.

Update `pantheon.yml` to reflect the following value(s):

```yml:title=pantheon.yml
api_version: 1
web_docroot: true
# See https://pantheon.io/docs/pantheon-yml/#enforce-https--hsts for valid values.
enforce_https: full+subdomains
php_version: 7.4
database:
  version: 10.4
drush_version: 10
build_step: true
protected_web_paths:
  - /private/
  - /sites/default/files/private/
  - /sites/default/files/config/
```

## Add Composer-managed Directories to gitignore

Any dir into which composer must write, must be `.gitignore`-ed.

## Use SCSS/Less Compiler

Composer require scss_compiler:

```bash{promptUser: user}
composer require drupal/scss_compiler
```

This is the [readme in the most recent version of the module](https://www.drupal.org/project/scss_compiler):

<blockquote>

```yml
# my_{module|theme}.libraries.yml
main:
  version: VERSION
  css:
    theme:
      scss/styles.scss: {}
      less/styles.less: {}
```

By default, compiled files are saved to `public://scss_compiler`

Also you can define `css_path` â€” path where to save the compiled file, path relative to module/theme where `libraries.yml` place, for example:

```yml
# my_{module|theme}.libraries.yml
main:
  version: VERSION
  css:
    theme:
      scss/styles.scss: { css_path: '/css/' }
```

File will be saved to `my_module/css/styles.css`

Assets path option allows to define where static resources places, by default it's a module/theme folder. Full path to assets folder. Supports token for theme/module.

```yml
# my_{module|theme}.libraries.yml
main:
  version: VERSION
  css:
    theme:
      scss/styles.scss: { assets_path: '@my_module/assets/' }
```

url(images.jpg) in css will be compiled to
url(modules/custom/my_module/assets/image.jpg);

</blockquote>

## Step +1: add/commit/push

## Step +1: verify the build completed successfully in Dashboard and/or Terminus
